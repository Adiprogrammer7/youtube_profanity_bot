00:03
all right let's start by making some
00:05
coffee go ahead and boil the water
00:07
pick your favorite selection of beans
00:09
James con fuoco is my preference way I'm
00:11
out 21 grams toss those in a burr
00:13
grinder grab your favorite brew method
00:14
Kalita wave but I'll be using throw a
00:17
filter in there pre wet it you know the
00:19
drill dump of water out get those grinds
00:21
in even them out throw them on a scale
00:23
let's go like 60 grams of water when you
00:25
get there stop for like 25 seconds let
00:27
that boil happen go ahead and keep
00:29
pouring they're like 200 grams stir it
00:31
up pour on like 3/10 let it ride grab
00:35
your favorite mug get your frame get
00:37
your composition you want to make sure
00:38
you get this done fast cuz steam is
00:40
coming out it's better to get it in real
00:42
life and have to photoshop that line up
00:44
your frame snap the photo now you bring
00:47
those photos into the computer you're
00:48
looking at them in lightroom you're
00:49
picking which frame you want which ones
00:51
a little off-center which one might be a
00:53
little more focused you finally land on
00:55
the one that you like but then you
00:56
realize into yourself seems a bit bright
00:58
how do I make this a little more
00:59
dramatic how do I make this stand out a
01:01
little more how do I make this photo a
01:03
little more special how do I take it
01:05
from this raw to this finished photo how
01:09
do I do that you do that with the radial
01:11
mask tool and this is how it works
01:14
[Music]
01:24
[Music]
01:25
so we're radio masks
01:27
really let's use own in it really lets
01:29
you focus in drive focus towards a sweet
01:33
spot of a photo
01:34
maybe it's the product maybe it's a
01:35
certain part of a portraits face or a
01:37
certain area of a landscape but a radial
01:39
mask really dials in on a specific area
01:42
but on top of that it's twofold
01:45
here's what it also lets you do is just
01:46
illuminate a certain area without
01:49
affecting the entire background so like
01:51
this instance of coffee if I only want
01:53
at the kettle and the pots would be a
01:55
little bit brighter but I don't want to
01:57
adjust the exposure of the whole photo
01:59
and have everything get brighter then I
02:02
can just apply a radial mask to those
02:05
two items and increase their brightness
02:07
without affecting anything around it by
02:09
clicking that invert button you're able
02:12
to invert it and effect everything but
02:15
the coffee pot and the mug that's why
02:17
this tool is so so useful and it's super
02:21
easy to do you're just clicking this
02:22
button here you draw your mask you can
02:24
change the shape of the mask and then
02:27
you're just affecting the exposure or
02:29
the contrast or all of these settings
02:31
down the right side here just for what's
02:33
inside that masked area when you're
02:36
happy with that you're just left to
02:37
feathering it and hitting okay the best
02:39
way to explain feathering is to imagine
02:42
a spotlight now it's design is to
02:44
specifically light up a target area it's
02:47
a directional super bright beam of light
02:50
its edges are harsh so feathering is
02:53
gonna take that harsh spotlight and make
02:56
the edges softer so that the whole scene
02:58
just appears to be less of a directional
03:02
beam of light brushes those edges that
03:04
blends them in lights the whole scene
03:06
makes it subtle it's a nuance it's
03:08
delicate it makes that image where he
03:11
better when you feather it out without
03:13
that obvious shape of brightness now you
03:17
can also use a linear mask which is the
03:19
exact same thing it's just linear so I'm
03:21
gonna click that button right here I'm
03:22
gonna drag it in from the left side
03:24
we're just gonna
03:25
working that entire left side of the
03:27
photo where the window light is coming
03:28
and the laptop that's gonna help me
03:30
radio mask expose that Center even
03:32
better you can also apply as many masks
03:35
as you want you can apply it one two
03:36
just affect the background then you can
03:38
apply a second just to affect the
03:39
subject so when you start getting
03:41
creative with these masks is when you
03:43
really start to see unique results
03:45
within your photography and it is so
03:47
easy to do how sick was that how good is
03:53
the radial mask tool my absolute
03:56
favorite and now you have one more tool
03:57
under your belt when it comes to editing
03:59
photos so I hope you enjoyed that hope
04:01
you use it for landscapes portraits
04:03
still-life product photography
04:05
especially it works so well that's it
04:08
for me
04:15
[Music]00:07
[Music]
00:37
boring folks welcome back to the blog I
00:40
I did something real stupid last night
00:45
check this out I don't know you can see
00:47
that in there still got a blood stain
00:50
okay so I was last night before I was
00:54
packing up to go home I was flipping a
00:56
knife around and I shouldn't have been
00:57
cuz knives are not toys they're tools I
00:59
of all people should know this but I was
01:01
flipping it around dropped it got my
01:03
hand out of the way on the way down it
01:05
sliced my knee open then it cut through
01:07
my jeans and it stung at first I was
01:09
like aah but then like the blood pooled
01:11
like and soaked my pants and yeah that
01:13
kind of looks serious so the guy put
01:15
pressure on it called my cousin who's a
01:16
paramedic my FaceTime it was like oh
01:18
this is bad should I do
01:20
sar like took my pants off and like
01:21
showed him he's like that's probably
01:22
like two to four stitches like I
01:24
probably just tape it so it wasn't like
01:26
a massive cut but it's like a surgically
01:28
clean perfect like deep cut enough where
01:31
like this skin was just like straight up
01:33
opened keeping pressure on it i hobbled
01:35
down the stairs into the cage got up on
01:38
an Apple box with my pants down around
01:40
my ankles and I I got some gaff tape and
01:43
I taped it closed and I drove home and I
01:46
guess sometimes you still got to learn
01:48
the hard way but it is important I had a
01:50
first-aid kit in my truck which everyone
01:52
should have a first aid kit at their
01:54
house office truck vehicle one at the
01:56
house and the OP everywhere because I
01:58
was gonna go buy some of those like
01:59
sticky butterfly strip things instead of
02:02
getting stitches cuz I kind I don't want
02:04
to go to a hospital right now but I had
02:06
them in my truck which was great so I
02:07
was able to get home clean it with
02:09
alcohol
02:09
that sucked and then I taped it together
02:13
and kept my leg up so now I'm kind of
02:16
like limping around the office not
02:18
because I can't walk oh but more so
02:21
because I'm trying to prevent my knee
02:22
from bending so it doesn't rip open and
02:24
I have to go get stitches because that
02:26
would just suck so I refuse tape is
02:28
gonna work I wore sweatpants today to
02:30
try and make it a little bit easier on
02:32
me I did though I did
02:34
I did ruin a perfectly good pair of
02:36
jeans though check out these photos
02:37
graphic graphic photos viewer discretion
02:41
okay it's not that bad it's not that bad
02:45
but I just always learn the hard way I
02:51
wanted to point out something real quick
02:53
as well that was also mentioned and if
02:55
you got her vlogs from some comments if
02:56
you buy Under Armour socks from Amazon
02:58
why do they label them left and right
03:01
I never I just put them on and they're
03:03
never I've always got the right on the
03:05
left or two rights and two left's then
03:06
anywhere I go when I got to take my
03:09
shoes off people are always like dude
03:11
you got to write you got to rights on a
03:13
mic it's it's it's just ink it it means
03:16
nothing why why do you do that okay I
03:20
wanted to show you guys the finished set
03:23
some people thought in the last video
03:25
that this was a green-screen and this is
03:26
definitely not a green-screen these are
03:30
real cameras this is an actual shelf
03:34
there's my first camera this is uh this
03:37
is all real and I can dim these I can
03:40
dim this whole background which is
03:41
pretty cool with this little dimmer
03:43
switch here so if it's too brighter if
03:45
it's not enough or if I want to just go
03:47
at the center so that's pretty cool so
03:49
this is kind of what we came up with we
03:51
were building this in the last vlog I
03:53
mounted a mic up to this cross beam and
03:55
that sits perfectly right in front of me
03:58
when I'm talking
03:59
got that going into the c200 with a 14
04:01
mil down to the small HD which I think
04:04
has recently broke because I can't seem
04:06
to get my levels in the pushing this
04:08
joystick left just hasn't been working
04:10
lately I'm not sure why that's going on
04:12
but and then I set up the new 300x
04:14
this aperture light is insane cuz now
04:17
you can go warm tones and cool tones in
04:20
the one light so huge huge improvement
04:23
that means I don't have to gel this
04:26
light anymore and take the take the
04:28
modifier off and gel it up it's just
04:30
with like the push of a button or the
04:32
app and a phone and that's kind of like
04:34
what I'm looking at when I make an angle
04:37
- I'd still like to probably put some
04:40
kind of rim light in like up here some
04:43
kind of hair light to separate the
04:44
background a bit more
04:46
it's a little bit flat but I'm pretty
04:48
I'm pretty psyched on it now I've gotten
04:51
acoustic blanket on the floor here so
04:53
the reason I have the sound blanket on
04:55
the ground is to just prevent the sound
04:57
from bouncing around too much when I
04:59
emptied everything out of this room it
05:00
just sounded still like a little bit too
05:02
too much echo too much reverb I have
05:05
three sound panels in the ceiling but
05:07
still needed something to prevent the
05:08
bounce from the floor I've also been
05:11
bringing in a panel from the warehouse
05:12
to put in the corner to kind of act like
05:14
a bass trap all right that's the huge
05:18
panel I've been bringing into my office
05:20
it's supposed to be mounted to the wall
05:21
up here in the warehouse but I had the
05:24
sprinkler moved it used to be in the
05:26
middle right where that hole is and I
05:28
had it moved over to the side because
05:29
obviously like who wants a sprinkler
05:32
right there and I might I might put a
05:35
fire pole in here add another video this
05:38
is the panel it could never go back on
05:40
the wall because now this is in the way
05:42
and it can't anyways so I carry this
05:45
basically into the office into the
05:48
corner when I need that extra sound
05:50
dampening I think it makes a difference
05:52
another difference that will help
05:53
massively is bringing the mic closer to
05:55
your mouth I also taught that in that
05:57
audio tips and tricks video you can see
05:59
that this is pretty close to me the
06:01
closer you get it the better the audio
06:03
is going to sit down obviously you don't
06:04
want it in your shot but that is one way
06:06
to get better sounding audio without
06:09
having to do any of this it's just bring
06:11
the mic closer
06:12
[Music]
06:30
[Music]
06:42
wanted to chat quickly about the kind of
06:45
videos that I've been making lately and
06:47
just content as a whole that I'm seeing
06:49
on YouTube and and just and being made
06:52
lately Wow all this is happening in the
06:54
world and being limited to where you can
06:57
go and what you can do and with whom
06:59
makes it very challenging to make
07:01
content that's what I've learned I've
07:02
tried to overcome those challenges and I
07:04
feel like I have in many instances and
07:06
then there are some instances where I
07:07
feel like I haven't at all and it's been
07:09
really difficult and I'll put something
07:10
out and just kind of think I didn't
07:12
really I didn't really feel that one but
07:14
I did it anyway to just try and keep
07:16
things moving and it's hard because I
07:18
think that's good I think it's a good
07:21
thing to do but I also think it's a bad
07:22
thing to do I wanted to come out and say
07:25
that I think something that's very
07:27
important that you as a creator should
07:30
make sure that you're doing during times
07:32
like this is not just forcing out
07:35
material that you're used to making
07:37
because you feel like you should keep up
07:39
with it but use the time to dial in what
07:42
you really like about making content
07:44
what really makes you love it we've got
07:46
a perfect opportunity right here to
07:48
reset recalibrate think about what it is
07:51
that we really want to say what do you
07:54
want to show what do you want to tell
07:56
what do you want your audience to
07:58
experience to feel those things I think
08:01
if we figure them out and write them
08:03
down and bring those to life those are
08:06
the types of things that'll make us as
08:07
creators feel good inside it'll satiate
08:11
that's a great word that inner artist
08:13
that's just burning to do X and I don't
08:17
really get that by just churning out
08:19
videos weekly if I have a fun idea and I
08:22
like it I'm down I'll do it for sure but
08:24
I think it's easy especially to just
08:26
keep things moving during times unknown
08:28
times etc it's it's easy to fall into
08:30
that and become complacent and a little
08:33
stale and just kind of tired of those
08:36
types of things so recently on that note
08:38
we've just been going hard at this
08:40
Angels and Airwaves documentary because
08:42
that is something that not necessarily
08:44
appeals to the people that watch this
08:46
channel like we're here to check out
08:48
vlogs have fun photography
08:49
cinematography random stuff music
08:52
specifically a abanda not everybody
08:55
listens to that's not going to resonate
08:57
with the whole that's not broad and
08:59
you'll notice with YouTube a way to be
09:01
popular in a way to make content that's
09:03
engaging is to hit that broad audience
09:05
but that doesn't always make you feel
09:09
good you need to tell the stories that
09:11
you care about when you do that the
09:14
audience will resonate because they'll
09:16
feel the passion they'll feel how much
09:18
you love this topic versus churning
09:22
something out because you feel you have
09:24
to or you're just trying to keep the
09:25
ball rolling use this time to fan the
09:28
fire get those flames high because if
09:30
you care your audience will care and at
09:33
the end of the day I'd rather be psyched
09:35
on the things I'm making than just
09:36
feeling about them there's a really good
09:39
way to know if you made something that
09:41
you love I'm proud of my videos I like
09:44
my videos I don't love all of them but
09:46
it's very easy to know when you do love
09:48
one and when you find that that is what
09:51
you should be doing all the time this is
09:53
the trick to ask yourself if you're
09:55
really loving the content that you're
09:57
making I want you to remember the last
09:58
time you made something where this
10:00
happened maybe was the intro the b-roll
10:03
the music a really special part just
10:06
part of the talking head but you export
10:07
it just a section of that video and you
10:09
sent it to a bunch of friends cuz you
10:11
were psyched
10:12
hey Chris how check this out Matty what
10:14
do you think of this man calendar what
10:16
do you think holiday Kirk max all these
10:18
people all your friends unrelated people
10:20
that aren't creators but you just sent
10:22
them a little snippet of something
10:23
because you were really excited about
10:25
the direction it was heading or you
10:27
finished a video that you loved the
10:29
night progresses you get into bed
10:30
whatever you're going through your sub
10:31
boxes you're checking out what your
10:32
buddies are making or your other
10:33
favorite creators and then you just end
10:35
up watching your own video again because
10:36
you were so happy with the results
10:39
you're proud of it you want to see it
10:41
again
10:41
maybe then someone's watching it the
10:43
next day and you watch it again with
10:44
them but it's one of those special
10:46
videos that has a place inside that's a
10:48
little bit different from the rest now
10:50
think back to the last ten videos that
10:52
you made how many of those 10 videos
10:54
gave you that feeling that you wanted to
10:57
send if you wanted to share with every
10:59
single person you wanted to watch
11:00
yourself back over and over because you
11:02
were so psyched on how it went how it
11:04
came out if it's not all of those that's
11:07
where I posed the question to myself are
11:09
you really making the stuff that you
11:10
want to be making do you even like what
11:12
you're making sometimes the answer is no
11:15
for me it's a resounding no sometimes
11:16
it's a resounding yes
11:18
when I have that feeling where I want to
11:19
watch my own work again because I'm so
11:21
amped on how it turned out and I've sent
11:23
it to so many people to watch and enjoy
11:25
that that's the feeling that I want from
11:29
every single piece of art that I make I
11:31
want that and I want other people to
11:34
have that and if I'm not doing that all
11:36
the time that's what I should be
11:39
striving for all the time too many
11:41
occasions I'm just uploading a video or
11:43
I'm making something going through the
11:45
paces because it's just that's my job
11:46
here you go but I want to chase those
11:48
feelings I want to chase those videos
11:51
that make me feel
11:52
I want to chase the videos that make me
11:54
feel like a kid again like I've just got
11:56
my first camera like I just experienced
11:58
video editing for the first time and I
12:00
get that when I nail those videos I get
12:02
that when I
12:03
make a video like the mountains won't
12:05
remember me I can't pull that off every
12:07
single day I can't but I would still
12:10
rather put more effort and more creative
12:12
power towards trying to get there than
12:16
just giving up before I even started
12:23
where are you all right I got to change
12:32
my bandages I don't think I did the best
12:36
job taping it up also how awesome is
12:39
this first-aid kit this is the best
12:41
thing ever got it on Amazon not
12:43
sponsored I just I I love this stuff
12:47
this kits and being prepared and having
12:50
those things and you're just like I love
12:53
it link below if you don't have a
12:55
first-aid kit so it's a bit of a random
13:02
video I was just sitting upstairs kind
13:04
of thinking to myself like what do I
13:05
want to make today and there's a list of
13:06
things but I really like that analogy of
13:09
look back at the 10 videos you made
13:11
recently and do they give you that
13:12
feeling where you want to send them to
13:14
everyone and I thought I'd just share
13:15
that concept with you to maybe inspire
13:17
you to reach for that same level
13:20
starting today maybe you already are
13:22
maybe you're psyched on all the stuff
13:24
that you're making and if you are that's
13:25

00:29
[Music]
00:39
what's up everybody Peter MacKinnon here
00:41
welcome back to yet another two minute
00:44
Tuesday it's so great to have you here
00:45
and see all of your smiling faces and
00:47
today is photo assignment number four
00:50
and it kind of looks like eight or nine
00:52
but photo Simon number four where the
00:56
theme was the new normal
00:58
there was a lot of stuff to look at
01:00
going through this hashtag it kind of
01:02
felt a little all over the place but I
01:03
like that I think the deeper the theme
01:05
the more difficulty I have trying to
01:08
pick the photos which is good it's fun
01:10
when it's easy and you search the
01:11
hashtag in the first like twenty are
01:13
just bangers you're like wow this is
01:14
amazing to keep scrolling and it's just
01:16
constant heat constant heat right your
01:19
phone overheats it shuts down so there's
01:21
a little bit more difficult to scroll
01:23
through that hashtag and really look for
01:25
images that I felt represented this
01:27
theme well and I'm not necessarily
01:29
looking for banger photographs just
01:31
photographs that tell a story
01:32
photographs that are clever that are
01:34
smart that really basically shine a
01:37
light on what the new normal could mean
01:39
or what it is or what it means to you
01:42
and that's why we do photo assignments
01:44
so today the new normal let's just jump
01:46
right into things and take a look at
01:48
image number one also two things are
01:51
different one how does this set look
01:53
comment below do you like the camera
01:55
wall this is set B what do you think you
01:57
like it - my mustache is gone see ya
02:00
number one a photo from one da
02:03
underscore boy on his photo of a dog
02:06
looks like a German Shepherd with his
02:07
hand on the
02:08
no it was nice it kind of made me sad
02:09
I'm assuming less dogs are getting walks
02:12
this guy wants to go out and play and he
02:14
wants to go play fetch and run around
02:15
and jump in ponds and play with people
02:17
and he can't right now made me think of
02:19
my dog so we're also just staring at the
02:21
windows one to gloat thanks for
02:24
submitting quite enjoyed that next up is
02:26
a photo from Anthony of this beautiful
02:27
black and white Porsche of someone
02:29
walking the contrast separation with the
02:31
sun shining down perfectly dividing that
02:33
center wall between these two windows
02:36
honestly monster composition it's just
02:39
if you zoom in you can see this person
02:41
as a mask on which is definitely a theme
02:44
I saw in the hashtags that's becoming
02:46
more and more about just a thing friend
02:48
of mine Jeff bond Christiano who is an
02:50
amazing Instagrammer dope photographer
02:52
all-around cool guy made kind of like a
02:55
prediction earlier on this was several
02:57
several weeks ago now he was saying like
02:58
I think face masks are gonna become like
03:00
a new fashion trend like different
03:02
styles and different things are gonna
03:04
start emerging where it's just normal
03:06
and cool and trendy to wear a face mask
03:08
but this great photo also if you're not
03:10
following my friend Jeff go give him a
03:12
follow tell him I said hello he dropped
03:14
some great tips on his Instagram stories
03:15
and yeah dope artist it's also got a
03:18
killer beard moving on next photo from
03:22
Gilbert from the Northern Quarter
03:24
Manchester and this is of an individual
03:26
crossing what looks like days off the
03:29
calendar captain just says 35 days of
03:31
lockdown the world is still upside-down
03:32
yet if you look through the window that
03:36
correlates with the caption with the
03:38
world being upside down so that's
03:40
something that you missed that's a small
03:41
detail that you probably don't even see
03:43
the first time I did
03:45
I missed it entirely the first time went
03:46
back read it saw it liked it even more
03:49
so attention to detail is on point with
03:51
this photo from the markings on the wall
03:52
to the TV to the upside down world
03:55
through the window that's just kind of
03:57
how things are right now and we're just
03:58
all kind of starting to slowly get used
04:00
to it which could be the new normal
04:02
great photo easily one of my favorites
04:05
next up we got a photo from Ottawa
04:07
Ontario from journey via lens and that
04:10
is someone handing someone a coffee some
04:12
Tim Hortons coffee through a
04:13
drive-through window wearing
04:15
and pre-pandemic you'd never see that
04:17
pre kovat life before kovat you would
04:20
never just see someone wearing gloves at
04:22
a drive-through window but now it makes
04:23
so much sense you see gloves and yeah of
04:25
course
04:26
how could you not be wearing gloves I
04:28
think that's gonna be something we're
04:29
all getting used to yeah I mean gloves
04:31
make sense especially to drive through
04:33
window preparing food a very easy basic
04:35
photo of a moment cotton time that
04:37
absolutely captures the photo assignment
04:39
theme journey violins great job what did
04:42
you order
04:43
triple triple ohh a four by four that's
04:46
four cream four milk here in Canada you
04:48
get a four by four that is uh that's
04:50
gnarly and a Wayne Gretzky that's nine
04:53
by nine nine cream nine sugar not even
04:55
all Tim Hortons know about the Wayne
04:56
Gretzky if you're if you're going nine
04:58
by nine you've got that's not even a
05:01
thing that's a milkshake next up from
05:03
Charleston South Carolina we have a
05:05
photo from Grant
05:06
Geyer photo our new normal is spending
05:09
time as a family creating together
05:10
making memories how are you spending
05:11
your time and I love that because a lot
05:13
of us are inside now with our families
05:16
not that we weren't before but we're
05:17
spending way more time together because
05:19
we're all locked inside and you're
05:21
forced to come up with new routines and
05:23
new things to do that are outside the
05:24
normal of going to work and the kids
05:26
going to school and so on and so forth
05:28
them being a father and having kids
05:30
myself this is definitely relatable and
05:32
it was just super cute it was really
05:34
well done well composed
05:35
well colored I really liked it great
05:37
message and just like an overall good
05:39
outlook so I appreciated this and wanted
05:41
to include this because I knew there
05:43
would be other people out there with
05:43
families that could also relate which
05:46
technically if you think about it should
05:48
really be the new normal should kind of
05:50
be what we do anyway time just gets in
05:52
the way and the world gets in the way
05:53
and if anything some of the things that
05:55
we've learned that I've learned during
05:56
this lockdown is we can make more time
05:59
for this kind of thing
06:00
absolutely next up from Budapest Hungary
06:03
ha toe Tov Tata matech I'm just terrible
06:09
the new normal my underpants radius has
06:11
increased significantly throughout the
06:12
past few weeks if you know it you know
06:13
it and I love that he's on a Skype call
06:16
or zoom call or whatever call these days
06:19
and from the cameras angle it would look
06:21
like he's dressed up and ready for work
06:22
we're in the reality you're in shorts or
06:25
boxers or no pants at all in this case
06:27
that is what we were looking at and it's
06:29
very much the new normal
06:31
lots of online digital conference calls
06:33
lots of zoom calls conferences like this
06:35
Pat it was I got a little bit humor out
06:38
of that and I think we could all use a
06:39
little bit humor moving on this is a
06:41
very basic one but we've all seen it
06:43
it's the top-down please stay six feet
06:45
two meters apart
06:47
you see these everywhere I was in a shop
06:48
yesterday picking up supplies the same
06:50
thing you got those stickers store at
06:51
the store the little feet marks and it's
06:53
just just a part of how it is now will
06:55
they stay will they stick around you're
06:57
gonna have those big screens up
06:58
everywhere in front of the the cashier
07:00
and the customer maybe again it kind of
07:02
makes sense if you really think about it
07:04
but it's also a little bit sad moving
07:05
forward being like is that we really
07:07
gonna just be separated so much moving
07:09
into the future till there's a vaccine
07:11
or whatever who knows that was from
07:13
Toronto Ontario so another Canadian fly
07:15
the flag let's go enjoy the simplicity
07:18
of this
07:18
it was pixels by John again as I stated
07:21

07:23

that's what we're all about that's we're
07:37
here to do make people feel good get out
07:38

07:47
emotional one from Ragusa rome's you

07:52
co-workers and says Peter makinen
07:54
challenged us all to post a photograph
07:56
displaying the new normal it really puts
07:58
things into perspective if you didn't
08:00
already know the sacrifice in the amount
08:02
of work the frontline health care
08:04
professionals are putting in every
08:06
single day to keep us safe
08:08
so one thank you to images like this
08:12
although make you sad and are hard to
08:14
look at sometimes are very much
08:15
important to be shared because that is
08:17
the reality of what's happening right
08:19
now right today as you watch this this
08:22
could be happening the utmost respect
08:23
for these individuals thank you so much
08:25

10:14
interesting photography streets being

back to yet another video it's so great
10:44
to have you here and see all of your mat
10:48
that you've only been doing this for a
10:50
while like three and a half years wow
10:51
this is amazing you keep scrolling and
10:53
it's just constant heat constant heat
10:56
right your phone overheats it shuts down
10:59
it resets itself then you got to buy a
11:01
new SIM and then they're not
11:02
they have no Sims left because all the
11:04
stores are closed you're trying to do a
11:05
curbside pickup but then you you can't
11:07
schedule a pickup time and the lineups
11:08
are just huge and you're trying to wait
11:09
in the line then somebody butts the line
11:11
then it's just all because you guys are
11:13
taking such great photos what's up
11:16
everybody Peter McKinnon here welcome
11:17
back to yet another video it's weird to
11:19
have you all here and see your smiling
11:21
faces that's not right00:00
[Applause]
00:01
[Music]
00:18
hi I have a confession to make I didn't
00:22
want have to say this because it's kind
00:24
of awkward and uncomfortable but you
00:27
know transparency is important yeah so
00:34
this morning probably around I don't
00:38
know 10:30 a.m.
00:40
I had instant coffee yeah and it wasn't
00:49
that bad like I kind of enjoyed it got
00:55
off to a little bit of a late start
00:56
today but there's a few things I want to
00:57
talk about I want to show you want to
00:59
teach you with regards to photography
01:00
and there's a few things I need to do
01:02
here at the studio also I've been
01:06
practicing my card skills if you didn't
01:08
notice from the intro I just literally
01:10
kind of spend like 20 minutes a day
01:12
corentin´s doing weird things to us all
01:14
huh pizza magician again what these I've
01:20
been sitting on Apple boxes since we
01:22
moved in and you know what since
01:24
quarantine happened and I'm the only one
01:26
here and I I haven't been using this
01:29
office as I should be take this room for
01:33
example okay so this room right here
01:35
this view right here with all these cool
01:37
cameras this this is my personal office
01:40
like this is where I'm supposed to be
01:42
sitting editing making videos taking
01:45
calls you know when I got the class when
01:46
I can see out etc and we got this really
01:49
cool backdrop like they look at all
01:51
these awesome cameras behind me it looks
01:52
I mean it looks great the thing is I
01:55
just haven't been using this office at
01:57
all so since I'm the only one here now
02:00
I've been setting up my laptop in the
02:02
front room where we shoot all the main
02:04
angle things and I've just been hanging
02:06
out there all day maybe it's the
02:07
sunlight it's the fact that I can be
02:09
distracted and watch the road and
02:11
the cars but it just feels more like a
02:13
space I want to hang out it kind of like
02:15
when people come over your house and
02:16
everyone hangs out in the kitchen this
02:19
room like I didn't use this room once so
02:21
I think what would be cool is if I
02:23
actually moved this room into this main
02:25
area and then we turned this room into a
02:28
set somewhere we can film main angles
02:31
and have like a secondary dope spot with
02:34
lights and cameras and everything's
02:35
rigged up ready to go so we just walk in
02:37
there lights camera action instead of it
02:39
just being an empty room right now that
02:41
nobody's using I think I'm just gonna
02:42
start moving things and then we'll we'll
02:45
see what happens basically there needs
02:48
to be motivation for what I'm doing in
02:50
this office there needs to be motivation
02:52
to move that desk here just like there
02:53
needs to be motivation in your
02:55
photography and everything that you do
02:57
not motivation to like hey get up and
02:59
get after it but motivation to make your
03:02
ideas make sense the idea is the what
03:05
the motivation is the why and we'll get
03:08
into it in a second when I take some
03:09
flat-leaf photos and kind of show you
03:10
guys a little more detail but I've been
03:13
doing that lately
03:14
[Music]
03:30
[Music]
03:47
I mean it looks a lot like looks a lot
03:51
more polished already that's the one
03:52
bummer about like dialing in a space and
03:54
getting lights mounted on the roof and
03:55
mics and overhead cameras and stuff then
03:57
you switch one thing one small thing
03:59
like a desk that's a different height
04:00
and suddenly everything needs to be
04:02
adjusted the lights need to be tweaked
04:04
the mic and everything but it's good to
04:06
do that because I need to switch these
04:08
lights out anyway there's a lot of
04:09
changes that I want to make as is to
04:11
this current setup so no time like the
04:13
present
04:13
but let's dive in to the topic of
04:16
today's video which is having motivation
04:18
behind the things you do in your photos
04:20
just take a quick demo of me doing a
04:22
flat leaf or like how I would set up an
04:24
Instagram photo so something that I want
04:25
a photograph thought-process what I'm
04:27
gonna do you know it's gonna be brief
04:28
but I think you'll get something and I
04:30
think you'll walk away with like at
04:31
least an interesting thought random role
04:38
of my camera here what's the
04:40
significance to this why is it a zero
04:41
nothing just the fact that it looks cool
04:44
and it matches this doped print up here
04:46
which is special to me so I just thought
04:49
like it works not even the same camera
04:50
but it's close enough and it looks sick
04:53
look at this angle though this is sick
04:55
come on this is ridiculous
04:57
so look so why don't I use this all the
04:59
time what is wrong with me oh hang on
05:02
got those on in the background now we're
05:05
looking tasty crispy okay Peter what do
05:08
you mean by having motivation to do
05:10
certain things within your photos let's
05:12
take some dust particles for example
05:14
this was one of the most freezing things
05:16
I was talking to another photographer
05:17
friend of mine Sam about really wanted
05:19
to put some dust particles in a photo
05:20
because I thought this would enhancer
05:21
this would make it look cool and you
05:23
guys know I love Photoshop and doing
05:24
just random things the problem is you
05:26
can't just toss dust particles into a
05:29
photo what is the motivation to do that
05:31
well if you had a beam of light shining
05:33
in that would give motivation for dust
05:35
particles now it makes sense so I took a
05:38
flatly the other day of this particular
05:39
pocket knife that I got the other day in
05:41
the vlog from benchmade but you saw and
05:43
I took this shot here now this is what
05:46
the reality of it looked like this side
05:47
Instagram so whenever you see a photo
05:50
posted on Instagram and it looks
05:51
picture-perfect and everyone's life
05:52
looks amazing and the props and the
05:54
lighting you just think wow that is just
05:56
it's so good that's what it actually
05:59
looks like
06:00
when you see the raw version of it it's
06:02
not very impressive it's literally a
06:04
bunch of garbage on a desk in like a
06:06
muddy boot there's a muddy boot on the
06:08
desk that's reality
06:09
you see Instagram crafted it's edited
06:13
it's manipulated it's just dust
06:15
particles everything looks just right
06:17
and that is what's presented to you
06:20
now that's twofold it's a good and it's
06:22
bad it's a bit of a false representation
06:24
of life and just products in general but
06:27
that's advertising that's how things are
06:29
sold and when it comes to products and
06:30
certain types of photography I don't
06:32
think there's anything wrong with that
06:33
but I wanted to show you the before and
06:35
the after because there's a lot of
06:36
people I think that can be inspired by
06:38
seeing something so basic look so
06:41
extravagant and think I can do that too
06:43
because you you you absolutely can do
06:47
that too now why am i bringing up this
06:48
knife in this boot in this reality
06:51
versus Instagram thing because it's all
06:52
it's all connected okay it's all
06:55
encompassed into what it is that we do
06:58
as content creators online Pete you're
07:00
using a lot of words I know just wait
07:03
bear with me the motivation for having a
07:06
boot on the desk was because this
07:08
particular product has a tactical hard
07:10
use hard work feel to it
07:12
so having riding gloves and a muddy
07:14
boots supports the theme of the photo
07:16
there's context there for it there's
07:18
motivation there for it that's why it
07:21
works instead of it just being super
07:23
random making zero sense confusing
07:25
everybody I feel like those tiny details
07:27
are what separate amateurs and
07:30
professionals and I've been on both
07:32
sides of the spectrum complete noob
07:34
amateur professional lost in the middle
07:37
that is the journey of a photographer
07:38
also that whole like side rant of
07:40
Instagram versus reality it kind of fits
07:43
into this I might have just started
07:44
rambling but it makes sense and I'm
07:47
gonna leave it in here because it's you
07:48
know it's true it's helpful to me as
07:50
well
07:51
[Music]
07:58
so I'm looking for some props some
08:00
things that I can use to make this photo
08:02
this flat lay of this here pocket knife
08:05
a little more interesting so it's black
08:07
its tactical it's slim got to find some
08:09
props that work and I need motivation
08:11
for those props to make sense example
08:15
this does not make sense as a prop does
08:18
it look cool in a photo yes it doesn't
08:21
make sense
08:23
this makes sense it's got a kind of
08:26
tactical feel like it could be like a
08:27
rail sight to that right there that
08:30
would work
08:31
[Music]
08:38
okay the fact that I can still cross my
08:42
legs is a miracle we got some cord we
08:44
have a cheese plate we have a holster we
08:47
the grid from an aperture 120 D because
08:49
it looks what does it look like kind of
08:51
like some military camo I pretend like I
08:55
know what I'm talking about
08:56
and then we have on ammo crate these are
08:59
ammo crates we're sending out seeing
09:00
with a bunch of our stuff packed in it I
09:02
think it might be cool to empty the
09:05
crate and shoot down into it with this
09:07
stuff kind of spilling over the sides
09:08
that's the plan my moist own you guys
09:12
about texture that's sick of that let's
09:20
set this up near the window because
09:21
there's more natural light there alright
09:23
so that is the plan right there to shoot
09:25
down inside come will drape some props
09:28
around to kind of dress it up in yeah
09:32
[Music]
09:35
all right this is hard to film and do at
09:37
the same time but what I've used that
09:39
little play for there's a little trick
09:41
of mine when I do flat lace I'll show
09:43
you here is an example that's way
09:45
clearer so instead of just shooting a
09:47
flat lay photo straight down with stuff
09:50
kind of in and around and wherever and
09:53
you've got all your everything is
09:55
looking pretty cool and there you go
09:56
you've got like your little set up
09:58
sometimes what I like to do to make the
10:00
item that we're focusing on stand out
10:02
more is elevate it off the surface
10:05
slightly so in order to do that you just
10:07
got to find something that works to
10:09
basically lift it up so in this instance
10:11
this little cheese plate here is the
10:13
perfect size to come in on top and just
10:17
balance this knife on so now when I'm
10:19
looking top down it is gonna pop that
10:22
off the background giving a slight depth
10:25
of field to these items right so it's
10:28
just gonna make this stand out more
10:30
[Music]
10:36
it's my little sniper net ghillie suit
10:40
whatever doesn't really work
10:41
since I'm shooting inside I went with
10:44
the little bolts that actually held the
10:45
top to this box down zip but those
10:47
little bits looked cool okay back up
10:49
items a wider cheese plate and I found
10:52
some Springs and I thought this paper
10:55
might actually work pretty cool too to
10:56
add texture all right so these Springs
11:00
look kind of industrial
11:02
[Music]
11:06
all right so there it is is what we're
11:09
looking at I'm losing light so we have
11:11
to do this quickly so give me one second
11:13
and you'll see the picture in three two
11:16
one okay we are we are all finished I
11:23
made a little bit I made a little bit of
11:25
a mess this kind of just odds and ends
11:28
everywhere I think those photos turned
11:30
out great it represents the knife very
11:31
well in my opinion it looks cool but
11:34
going back to what I said at the
11:35
beginning about Instagram versus reality
11:36
if you were to just see that picture
11:38
straight off you'd think if I could only
11:41
do a flatly like that one day and that's
11:44
also me assuming you like what I did I
11:46
like it and if you did too you might
11:48
think wow how did like I wish I could do
11:50
that that is it like that is the reality
11:53
of the situation here putting a bunch of
11:55
random things in a box snapping a photo
11:58
it's just remembering the motivation for
12:01
those things they're in the box like if
12:02
there is a bottle of Purell in there it
12:04
wouldn't make sense
12:05
so having motivation for the items that
12:07
are in the flat lay or your photography
12:09
and just what you're doing in general
12:11
does what you're doing have purpose the
12:13
idea is the what the motivation is the
12:15
why this looks so much better
12:20
I'm really happy with that all right
12:23
that might have been a bit of a random
12:24
video a bit of a random vlog tutorial
12:26
kind of but I wanted to take that photo
12:28
today and I kind of just wanted you to
12:30
come along in the raw experience and and
12:32
see what I see when I'm taking photos
12:34
for Instagram no matter if it's for
12:36
Peter McKinnon its Instagram account or
12:38
Pete's pirate life Instagram account
12:40
that's kind of the thought process
12:41
that's what I do and I wanted to bring
12:43
you along for the journey
12:44
so if you made it this far you are a
12:47

what's up everybody peter mckinnon here
01:46
welcome back to yet
01:48
another video and today we're talking
01:49
drones dji
01:51
drones with the new mavic air 2.
01:54
i was going to say mavic air pro 2 or
01:56
the mavic mini pro
01:58
phantom 5 v professional phantom
02:01
obsidian
02:02
drone so many drones there's a there's
02:04
literally there's
02:05
so many drones that's today intro
02:09
[Music]
02:19
[Applause]
02:20
alright welcome back so good to have you
02:22
here let's take a look at the mavic air
02:25
2. now i'm going to pull a marquez
02:27
brownlee on you guys and and say
02:29
i've been flying this now for the past
02:31
few weeks
02:33
it's true we have been keeping social
02:36
distancing
02:37
at the forefront of our minds and making
02:39
sure we're being safe and abiding by
02:41
those rules as well as drone rules and
02:43
local laws regarding
02:45
aerial craft uavs sent gabriel a bit of
02:49
a manhunt to find the best possible
02:51
drone footage that he could over the
02:53
past couple weeks with
02:54
the mavic air ii we were really able to
02:56
test this thing out and
02:58
get flying with it actually get some
03:00
experience under the belt
03:01
before making a review like this so this
03:03
has been used this was the extra one
03:05
that we sent so that we could do this
03:06
unboxing so i'm going to show you what
03:08
comes in the box if you were to get
03:10
the mavic air 2. we'll talk about the
03:12
price we'll talk about the specs
03:13
is it good should you upgrade is there a
03:16
point to upgrading
03:17
are we past are we peaked are we where
03:20
are we
03:20
where do we sit in the spectrum of
03:22
drones and first
03:24
let's start by taking it out of the box
03:38
let's take a look at the air
03:43
there it is that's what you're looking
03:44
at that's the first glance at the mavic
03:47
air is it
03:48
is that stressing you out right there is
03:49
that stressing it's fairly light
03:51
it's good it's much lighter than the
03:53
mavic pro it looks like a mavic pro too
03:56
looks like it's in that kind of realm
03:57
that kind of world of design
03:59
the same as the mavic pro maybe that
04:01
worked really well for them
04:02
but it's still small but not as small as
04:05
the mavic
04:06
air i should go grab that mavic air for
04:08
reference
04:10
time me
04:14
[Music]
04:27
let's look at them side by side both
04:29
from a top down angle
04:30
so you can see quite a bit bigger
04:33
i'm so out of breath it literally ran
04:35
the whole way folded up they look
04:37
pretty similar one's not that much
04:40
bigger than the other
04:41
it's not that much bigger but still
04:44
to be noted it is a larger aircraft it's
04:47
kind of got the same
04:48
front gimbal cover as the mavic pro
04:51
series
04:52
significantly lighter with the battery
04:54
out of it
04:56
we got sensors on the bottom we got
04:58
sensors on the back front
05:00
nothing on the sides all right what else
05:03
we got in this box here
05:04
you got your paperwork you've got your
05:07
controller
05:08
that's new take a look at that that is
05:11
certainly a departure from the mavic air
05:13
controller
05:14
that's for sure and then we got our
05:15
little accessories box in here
05:18
taking a look here cables chargers
05:21
adapters
05:22
probably extra propellers
05:25
all the stuff that we've come to know in
05:28
flying drones
05:29
this looks a lot more condensed though
05:30
like this looks way smaller this looks
05:32
way smaller
05:33
everything gets a little more dialed
05:34
each time there's like a release of a
05:36
drone everything gets tweaked and
05:37
finessed just enough that it makes you
05:39
feel like good
05:40
they're paying attention to detail
05:42
they're making the experience easier the
05:44
software is getting tweaked the firmware
05:45
is getting tweaked those things i always
05:47
appreciate with dji
05:49
you don't just feel like you're stuck in
05:50
the past they found something that
05:51
worked
05:52
years ago and just stuck to it didn't
05:53
change a thing
05:55
it evolves the software evolves the
05:57
experience evolves i appreciate that
05:59
taking a look at this controller
06:00
speaking of evolution one of the things
06:02
that's really cool in this is you'll
06:03
notice
06:03
no longer does it have the little
06:04
handles at the bottom that open up and
06:06
the phone goes in it
06:07
you'll see right here those thumb sticks
06:10
are now
06:11
just tucked into that side there's no
06:13
cover for them they just press
06:15
right in what i really like about this
06:17
controller now is how the phone gets
06:18
mounted which is up
06:20
top okay so no matter what size phone
06:22
you have
06:23
it's going to accommodate that that is
06:26
sick
06:28
that is so sick and that just pushes
06:31
right down
06:32
to clean up it's a much nicer controller
06:34
in my opinion i really like this
06:35
controller
06:36
you might notice there's no more there's
06:38
no more flip up antennas
06:40
because you never know which like
06:41
everyone always has it in a different
06:43
orientation
06:44
it's a little straight out straight up
06:45
oh like it's it's always all over the
06:47
place they're integrated into this now
06:49
you don't have to worry about it anymore
06:50
it's just done
06:51
pull this out put your phone in it start
06:52
flying never really liked having my
06:54
phone in the bottom
06:55
this looks big enough that i could
06:57
probably fit it in here with the case
06:58
and all things would work well
07:00
i wish this was like a tad smaller or
07:02
some magical way it broke apart and
07:05
and folded in on itself so that the
07:07
whole mavic air experience was just like
07:09
really that air like everything just
07:11
compacted
07:12
super slim but they do have the mavic
07:15
mini for
07:16
that so i guess you know what am i
07:17
complaining about if you were to bring
07:19
everything with you on a shoot all of
07:21
this
07:22
all of these things would need to go in
07:23
your bag so do you have room
07:25
for this stuff it's not too bad i mean
07:27
i've i could probably clear up a lot of
07:29
wasted
07:30
space of things that could go in my bag
07:32
instead of what's already in there
07:34
to make room for something like this
07:36
that is the entirety of what you would
07:37
need to successfully fly the mavic air
07:40
anywhere you go abiding by your local
07:42
drone laws
07:43
so i've always been a huge fan of the
07:45
mavic air i think
07:46
i think it's probably if we were to you
07:48
know get right down to it of
07:50
all the models that i've flown and that
07:52
i've owned the mavic air is probably my
07:54
favorite i found it like the easiest to
07:56
just send
07:56
straight up the fastest it wasn't too
07:59
big it wasn't too small the quality was
08:01
just right for what you were getting in
08:02
the form factor
08:03
and in the size portability it literally
08:06
checked every single box
08:08
so let's go over a few things this new
08:09
version has over the original mavic air
08:12
one
08:13
if you're comparing the quality of the
08:14
mavic pro 2 to say something like the
08:16
mavic air 2
08:18
i wouldn't say it's that fair of a
08:19
comparison because you are looking at
08:20
like a half inch sensor size
08:22
more in the mavic pro 2 and that is why
08:24
you're paying the extra tag
08:26
one of the things that they've improved
08:27
with the mavic air over the original
08:29
mavic air
08:30
is the transmission how far the drone
08:32
can go and still transmit signal and
08:34
video to your controller that was always
08:36
a little bit of a risky thing
08:38
with the air because it was over wi-fi
08:40
we were flying it in sweden once we were
08:42
way high above the car and even then it
08:44
was starting to kind of give out and be
08:45
a little bit dicey and you want complete
08:47
confidence when you're flying a drone
08:49
so they've upgraded from that wi-fi to
08:51
the ocusync
08:52
before it was four kilometers and i
08:54
think it was 720p resolution now you're
08:56
getting 10 kilometers
08:58
at 1080p resolution so like a massive
09:01
massive leap forward huge huge plus
09:04
flight time compared to the original
09:06
ridiculous improvement original being 21
09:08
minutes mavic air 2
09:10
34 minutes that makes a big difference
09:12
when you're trying to get the shot the
09:14
light is just right
09:15
you don't want to come back yet your
09:16
other drones beeping at you your 21
09:18
minutes is up
09:19
to have that extra time makes a huge
09:22
difference
09:23
mavic air 1 was 4k 30 mavic air 2
09:26
4k 60. yes please and thank you now the
09:31
photo camera also takes a massive leap
09:33
forward like a massive leap the original
09:36
mavic air
09:37
was 12 megapixels this mavic air 2
09:40
is 48 megapixels they weren't just like
09:43
yeah let's bump it up let's give it
09:44
let's go 20. let's go 25 30
09:47
35 40 48 in a package this size
09:51
is massive that is a huge huge benefit
09:54
for drone photographers not just people
09:57
trying to get cinematic video
09:59
with their drone one cool thing to point
10:01
out is that the mavic air 2 is actually
10:02
the only dji drone that offers 240
10:05
frames per second at 1080p
10:08
so if you want that tasty slo-mo and
10:10
you're following someone on a skateboard
10:11
down a track or you're shooting at a
10:12
skatepark or you're shooting anywhere
10:14
that you could benefit like a
10:15
side-by-side plowing through some mud
10:17
whatever
10:18
that 240 frames per second at 1080p with
10:21
usable
10:22
usable resolution is exciting
10:25
it still blows my mind it's the only one
10:26
that does that so i would say like the
10:28
mavic air 2 is probably like the first
10:30
mid-sized drone let's call it that
10:32
mostly checks all the boxes that all the
10:34
high-end drones have when it comes to
10:36
those features like your
10:37
photo quality and your resolution and
10:39
your flight time and all that stuff this
10:40
would be like the first kind of
10:42
mid-range drone size-wise that offers
10:45
that so that's that's
10:46
cool that we're kind of seeing like a
10:47
new class pop in with this guy
10:50
the mavic pro 2 for me was just like a
10:51
little big it's like a little big and
10:53
heavy when you're like just running gun
10:55
running around with a backpack with like
10:56
the smallest
10:57
kit you can possibly have the mavic mini
11:00
i love because you can fly it anywhere
11:01
and you don't need a license because it
11:02
comes in
11:03
under the weight limit which is awesome
11:05
but the air was always the sweet spot
11:07
for me so this just kind of picks up
11:09
where it left off but just
11:10
you know it's been working out in the
11:12
gym for a little bit longer and it comes
11:13
back better than it did before
11:15
so if i was gonna go buy one today and i
11:17
was faced with the multitude of options
11:19
that you
11:19
you're faced with when buying a drone in
11:21
2020 uh this is probably the one i'd go
11:23
with
11:24
honestly i'd go with this one or the
11:26
mavic mini and i only say the mavic mini
11:28
because again it comes in under that
11:29
weight limit which is massively
11:31
beneficial
11:32
but if i wanted cinematic high quality
11:34
that has
11:35
great battery life that i know is going
11:37
to perform at the quality that i need it
11:39
to that i
11:39
expect it to i'd be psyched on this
11:44
i am psyched on this so that's kind of
11:46
your first look i hope you enjoyed some
11:47
of the drone shots we were able to get
11:49
and collect
11:50
over the past few weeks i wanted to try
11:51
and fly this and get you guys some
11:53
examples
11:54
in a multitude of weather conditions a
11:56
multitude of landscapes
11:58
urban city forests high low
12:01
full mobbing snow it did well it flew
12:04
through all of it
12:05
it came back there was no issues so
12:08
that's it for me guys i hope that was
12:09
informative
12:10
wanted to show you the examples i wanted
12:11
to show you that we actually got out and
12:13
used it and hopefully you got enough out
12:14
of this to make an informed decision
12:16
if this is the drone for you we'll leave
12:18
things off with a couple more drone
12:20
shots guys that's it for me

00:11
April 22nd snowing that's not cool
00:16
that's not cool at all because it's
00:28
snowed it's not crazy I don't like the
00:31
snow anymore do you I want summer to
00:34
come okay go go love you did not think
00:36
I'd be having to put this puffed coat
00:38
back on the end of April tell you that
00:42
much that is a bummer Pete man you
00:51
should really clean clean that helmet
00:52
off before it started snowing I was
00:55
running a few errands
01:03
Oh hand is so cold
01:23
[Music]
01:27
all right yeah my kind of errands anyway
01:34
right now I have to take see here the
01:40
amount of times I've adjusted a camera
01:41
on a on a tripod okay right now I got to
01:44
load this quad into the back of that
01:47
truck and drop it off at the marina no
01:49
contact gloves on leaving it out front
01:50
I'll message them that it's there
01:52
they're putting like a new exhaust on it
01:54
and fixing a few things that I ruined
01:56
while riding and also pressure washing
01:59
also if there's anyone out there that
02:01
rides ATVs or four-wheelers or quads or
02:03
bikes curious this is like an argument
02:06
that I see online a lot do you call it a
02:08
bike you call it a quad no bike bicycle
02:10
means like by two cycles two wheels a
02:13
bicycle make sense I see a lot of guys
02:16
calling these bikes it's easier to say
02:18
bike it's faster but it technically
02:20
makes zero sense since there's four
02:22
wheels
02:24
help me out bike quad doesn't matter
02:29
[Music]
02:39
oh it's so cold outside oh my fingers oh

04:03
officer of Canada I should know the
04:07
title the interview is in the interview
04:09

04:17
me get my let me change take my hat off
04:21
probably you know respectful and by this
04:24
point I think you'll probably already
04:25
have seen it so what did you think I
04:27
mean I was trying to just do my part I
04:39
feel like you know this is super
04:42
Canadian like it doesn't get more
04:45
Canadian than this shirt these jeans
04:48
this mustache nothing worse than like
04:53
golden retriever dog hair all over you
04:56
everything everywhere at this point he's
04:58
like seven years old maybe eight years
05:00
old now that is like it's in the florist
05:03
in the walls in my mouth it's in my soul
05:05
did you guys know I have a tattoo of him
05:07
on my shoulder he's named power my
05:10
golden hand look at this okay that's him
05:14
[Music]
05:18

05:20
what are you using your hair what's your
05:22
process tap water tap water in my hands
05:25
nothing else but I think I'm gonna grow
05:27
it back I know
05:29
plan right here well I stick to it I
05:33
don't know this Canadian enough hey
05:44
sorry let's do this I have 30 minutes to
05:47
ask as many questions
05:48
good questions as I can that'll help
05:51
Canadians and young Canadians get
05:54
through this pandemic a little bit
05:55
easier with some information coming from
05:57
someone credible what am i have you've
05:58
already seen it you've probably already
06:00
seen it on the channel you know what's
06:02
going down right now
06:03
you know you know before I know so how'd
06:06
I do if you've already had
06:11
covin 19 you've tested positive for it
06:13
coming out of that are you immune to it
06:15
to getting it again that is another
06:17
great question and the scientific
06:19
evidence is not clear yet
06:21
[Music]

07:16
let's start with let's start with this
07:18
some of these are things I've ordered by
07:20
the way I think one of these I ordered
07:22
it might be this one actually do you
07:27
ever look at a box and just not
07:28
understand how it works cut cardboard
07:33
itself see this box right here my wife
07:35
got this for me I think half of this is
07:38
her stuff if you're always looking at
07:44
your computer at night and you need a
07:45
pair of blue light glasses I was like
07:47
what the hell are blue light glasses for
07:49
all the garbage that comes off your
07:51
computer screen when you're working
07:52
apparently it's not good for you
07:53
so now I have some blue light glasses
07:57

Star Wars cards he knows what he's doing
08:38

08:50

08:53
a knife to get more knives inside the
08:57
new CF Elite bug-out so psyched on this
09:02
everyone always asks Pete what's a good
09:05
first pocket knife that's the one right
09:06

09:06
Google that right there that's what you
09:09

09:25
pocket knife when this part of their
09:26
pocket is destroyed benchmate thank you
09:30
guys if you're looking for a pocket
09:32
knife benchmade you want a quick
09:35
backstory let me give you a quick that
09:36
hang on let's make this less creepy and
09:38
make a little more sense okay let's go
09:40
back to 2008 young Peter gets a job at
09:44
Henry's okay I'm working at the camera
09:46
shop I'm working in the back every
09:47
morning deliveries would come through
09:49
that back door like we're talking 3540
09:52
big plastic bins with these big hard
09:54
plastic tabs on them that needed to be
09:56
cut off so I'd be like using scissors or
09:59
I'd be using driving me crazy using
10:02
scissors or I'd be using a Leatherman or
10:04
some kind of like cable cutter until my
10:06
boss Nathan at the time came by and said
10:08
here dude BAM use my knife I was the
10:11
Spyderco delicas what he was using at
10:13
the time I still remember and I think he
10:14
still has it he sent me a picture of it
10:16
like three weeks ago my mind wasn't
10:17
blown
10:18
because he's had that in his pocket now
10:20
for like 12 years so young Peter takes
10:22
the Spyderco delica and starts slashing
10:24
all these bins open I was like this is
10:26
great the next day I don't have anything
10:28
open these bins Nathan's like here use
10:29
my knife third day fourth day second
10:32
week third week a month in Nathan's like
10:34
dude just buy your own pocket knife stop
10:36
taking punches I'm the cowboy your knife
10:37
gotta borrow your knife can I borrow
10:38
your knife anything cowboy Nathan hey
10:40
Nathan Nathan can I borrow your knife
10:43
over and over and over I finally went
10:46
out by my own Spyderco knife now a few
10:48
friends were like dude that's weird that
10:49
you carry a knife in your pocket like
10:51
why do you need that oh my god I use it
10:52
at work I cut open all the deliveries
10:54
like every single morning then it turned
10:55
into also using it to retrieve something
10:59
that fell down the side of my seat then
11:00
I'd cut a thread off my t-shirt or I'd
11:02
open some mail open an Amazon box
11:04
something would get stuck I'd stick the
11:06
knife blade in just a little bit wedge
11:08
it out I'd use the tip to pull a
11:10
splinter out of my finger clean my nails
11:12
use the back of it to undo a tripod
11:14
screw to undo the light switch screw
11:16
next thing you know I'm using a
11:18
pocketknife for little tasks around my
11:20
life every every single day okay listen
11:23
to this every single day so it's not
11:29
that I'm just a weirdo and I like I like
11:31
no I like sharp knife I love the touch
11:34
of Steel
11:35
it's just handy it's a handy tool to
11:37
have in your pocket at all times I've
11:38
been carrying a knife in my pocket since
11:40
2008 now as well
11:41
when benchmade sends you knives you get
11:44
site where my glass
11:48
oh what's that what are you doing right
11:50
now Peter using your knife to cut
11:52
something else off your glasses oh
11:53
that's handy yeah it is good thing I had
11:58
it with me okay
12:00
next up what do we got all right open
12:09
the letter with my night open why can't
12:30
I figure out boxes Oh summer
12:41
[Music]
12:45
clean this up and then I'll I'll be back
12:47
in a minute
12:48
[Music]
12:52
much better well we'll speak clean there
13:06
that's the fast way of getting the
13:08
garbage downstairs for whatever reason I
13:15
cannot keep this area clean when I want
13:18
to shoot this way I always just move all
13:20
the garbage to this side and then and
13:22
then it just ends up piling up and then
13:26
[Music]
13:42
you got one for recycling and one for
13:44
garbage
13:47
[Music]
14:01
guys it's been a good day thanks for
14:06
watching I'll see in the next video
14:17
[Music]
14:32
[Music]00:00
what's up everybody Peter MacKinnon here
00:02
I am a photographer youtuber
00:04
cinematographer I drink way too much
00:06
coffee all of those things but today we
00:09
have a very special video with a very
00:11
special guest none other than dr. Howard
00:13
new the deputy chief public health
00:15
officer of Canada we're gonna be talking
00:18
all things Kovan 19 prevention things to
00:21
look forward to things to look back on
00:23
how to keep you and your family safe
00:26
questions that you might have questions
00:27
that I have things that have been mixed
00:29
up we're gonna get some clarity on some
00:31
of these issues in an overall insight of
00:34
how we can globally come together and
00:36
beat this thing so without me yammering
00:38
on anymore let's bring in dr. Howard nu
00:40
and get asking some questions thanks for
00:45
taking the time to do this out of your
00:47
obvious massively busy schedule I'll
00:50
shift the camera there you go good you
00:54
got the YouTube background going and
00:55
everything yeah
00:57
did you ever think you'd be adding that
00:58
to the the profession doctor and now
01:00
youtuber I never I think my kids will be
01:03
impressed all right well yeah thanks man
01:07
thanks for jumping on but I thought like
01:09
what would probably be good is to do
01:11
like some rapid fire just like fast
01:13
questions that everyone has and then if
01:15
we put a longer form things that you can
01:17
dive into and we could just all listen
01:18
and hopefully learn a lot and come out
01:21
of this ready to fight this fire eh Oh
01:24
guys go right can you get kovat 19 from
01:26
a package arriving at your house I would
01:28
say generally no but it depends because
01:30
of the scientific evidence it shows that
01:33
the virus can last from hours to maybe
01:35
days but it depends on the surface so
01:37
hard metal surfaces as possible the
01:39
virus lasts longer than compared to
01:41
let's say a porous material like a
01:44
cotton shirt so for something like
01:46
cardboard I would say that the chance is
01:48
pretty unlikely that it is able to stay
01:50
on cardboard for a long period of time
01:52
but if you're concerned you can always
01:54
sort of maybe disaffected or leave it to
01:56
the side for a few days before you open
01:58
it just be on a safe side but I I really
02:00
think compared to things like you know
02:02
door handles sort of like cell phones
02:04
are certainly in the risk is much less
02:07
for the virus staying on okay let's say
02:09
cardboard that's good because we all get
02:10
a lot of mail I get a ton of mail
02:12
so that was one of my first things was
02:13
are all these packages up front of my
02:15
doors safest touch
02:17
what about like fast food and delivery
02:19
driving through a fast food restaurant
02:20
having food delivered to your house is
02:22
that risky
02:24
should it be avoided no I would say that
02:26
I think is very important to support
02:27
local businesses these days you know so
02:30
many things going on and I would say
02:31
that there's no evidence so far that the
02:33
virus is transmitted through food and
02:35
certainly if let's say the restaurant or
02:38
the fast food establishment practices
02:41
all the sort of that safe food handling
02:42
practices are public health that they're
02:44
supposed to do then that there really is
02:46
no risk that you order a fast food
02:48
because you should not get co19
02:51
infection we should also not be getting
02:53
Salmonella all all of those are there
02:55
food porn and you want to avoid so it's
02:58
not just a virus but any sort of a
03:00
foodborne disease anything that's good
03:02
okay thanks that's great chinch like on
03:04
that note of food like should you be
03:05
washing all your groceries like I'm here
03:07
just like rubbing down grape making sure
03:11
every leg do is that is that needed it
03:13
depends I guess a depending on the kind
03:15
of food I would say that safe food
03:17
handling practices apply for a fork over
03:19
nineteen as you would have even before
03:21
so for example if you buy like rock
03:23
chicken of course you should be you know
03:24
washing your hands before and afterwards
03:27
making sure you you don't use the same
03:29
cutting board for a raw chicken and
03:30
afterwards and cutting your fruits and
03:32
vegetables so all of them what we call
03:34
safe food handling practices should
03:36
apply in the case of kovat 19 as they
03:39
did for every other sort of
03:40
microorganism I would say that no extra
03:43
precautions are required over and above
03:45
which you should already be doing for
03:47
all of your food good to know that'll
03:50
save me some time at home for sure Hanna
03:51
when I'm leaving my house chattering I
03:54
was in a mask but no matter what that's
03:56
a good one that's something that
03:57
actually sort of I would say in play
03:59
right now in 95 that's obviously as
04:02
you've seen on the news a bit short
04:04
supply that's a very important that we
04:06
save those for our frontline health care
04:09
workers so the n95 and others definitely
04:11
for those people working in hospitals
04:13
are there essential workers they need to
04:15
have those masks the whole thinking now
04:17
is that based on some evidence that some
04:19
people may be able to transmit when
04:21
they're very mildly symptomatic or not
04:24
even aware that
04:24
they they may have some mild symptoms or
04:26
maybe no symptoms at all that's the
04:28
thinking behind what we now call
04:30
non-medical masks or face coverings and
04:32
so the thinking behind that is that if
04:34
you were to wear a face covering our
04:36
non-medical mask going out into public
04:38
it's not because you're trying to
04:40
protect yourself from others it's more
04:42
about you protecting others from you
04:44
your question about the gloves though I
04:46
would say by wearing gloves that you're
04:48
more conscious that they're on your
04:50
hands so if that prevents you from
04:51
touching your face or or being mindful
04:53
that then that you have to be careful
04:55
what you're doing with your hands yes
04:57
but certainly that's not a protection
04:58
because with your glove if you touch a
05:00
contaminated surface and then you rub
05:03
your nose you're just likely to become
05:04
infected yourself
05:05
yeah so you'd also have to take
05:07
precautions to dispose of those gloves
05:08
properly exactly because they're just as
05:10
not as not wearing them if you touch
05:12
something okay how about just like going
05:14
on a walk around the community that kind
05:16
of thing should be fine and safe to do
05:18
for like funny and families that are at
05:19
home right now people are at home just
05:20
want to get out to exercise that's safe
05:23
if you're just otherwise well and you
05:25
and your family need some fresh air
05:27
and you haven't say I just come back
05:29
from a travel you know overseas there's
05:32
less and less of that but for everyone
05:34
else
05:34
it is I think very good to get outside
05:36
practice your physical distancing that
05:39
two meters and you know your
05:41
neighborhood is fine should you be
05:43
keeping a certain distance from everyone
05:44
no matter where you are outside yes yeah
05:46
definitely always keep 2 meter distance
05:48
six feet apart what we call is you know
05:51
stay in your bubble and don't burst
05:53
anyone else's bubble ok interesting
05:55
question here can you get this or give
05:57
it to a pet it's interesting that
05:59
there's actually evidence now a
06:00
scientific evidence that some animals
06:03
have actually been able to get the virus
06:06
and certainly the evidence seems to
06:07
indicate they got it from humans so I
06:09
would say at this point if you actually
06:11
a word and you're sick you should
06:13
probably stay away from your pet so you
06:14
don't you know take the chance of giving
06:16
our your virus to your pets if you've
06:19
already had
06:19
Kovan 19:00 you've tested positive for
06:21
it coming out of that are you immune to
06:23
it to getting it again that is another a
06:26
great question and the scientific
06:28
evidence is not clear yet I certainly
06:30
for lots of other respiratory infections
06:32
caused by virus normally when you test
06:33
someone you have what we call you know
06:35
antibodies and they're in their system
06:37
they have immunity for a long time often
06:39
fro for life but this one is such a new
06:42
virus we're so learning about it and
06:44
based on studies from other countries
06:46
what we call a serological testing in
06:49
terms of looking at the antibodies
06:50
they'll test positive in terms of having
06:53
the antibodies but then it appears in
06:55
some studies or reports that these
06:58
people the immunity isn't long-lasting
07:00
and even then they might be able to get
07:03
another coop at 19 fection so it's not
07:05
quite clear yet and I would say at this
07:07
point certainly there's no clear
07:09
evidence that anyone who has had Coppa
07:11
19 as since we covered would be
07:13
considered immune for life that's very
07:15
informative thank you
07:17
one of the things that I was hearing a
07:18
lot like when this started you heard
07:20
everyone saying the flu kills this many
07:23
people
07:23
I worry from your opinion like why is
07:26
comparing kovat 19 to influenza a bad
07:28
idea for one seasonal flu is around
07:32
every year what happens that the flu
07:34
strains a mutator changed slightly from
07:37
year to year in most years and what
07:39
happens then is that most people will
07:42
have been exposed to a similar strain of
07:44
the flu maybe from a previous season and
07:48
therefore there's always a certain
07:49
proportion of the population that might
07:51
have some immunity against seasonal flu
07:54
even with the new strain that I come
07:56
that year what's happened with copa90 is
07:58
that this is such a new virus no one in
08:01
the world had any experience and our has
08:03
any immunity against it and we can see
08:05
what the devastating results have been
08:07
is just you know what so really I think
08:09
bad about this virus is that I would
08:11
call it a sneaky virus so is in some
08:14
ways it might actually be easier if it
08:16
you know some of the movies like
08:18
contagion right everyone that comes in
08:20
contact with the virus dies so you can
08:21
easily follow the trail of bodies oh
08:24
yeah so on so you know was with someone
08:26
else another all dead there whereas in
08:28
this case many people get severe
08:31
symptoms and end up needing
08:33
hospitalizations but also many people
08:35
might have mild symptoms are similar to
08:37
cold and so on and they recover but
08:40
during the time they have the symptoms
08:41
they don't know they have copa90 and
08:44
that's how we spread it to others who
08:46
then who knows how they might react to
08:48
it well they have a mild illness
08:49
themself or will they actually get
08:51
serious illness requiring
08:53
hospitalizations it is true that older
08:56
people generally knows with underlying
08:58
medical conditions you know with are at
09:01
higher risk overall for our forgetting
09:03
of severe consequences and needing
09:05
hospitalizations that certainly their
09:07
data shows that but unfortunately if you
09:09
look at the data as well a good 30
09:11
percent or so of the case reports we
09:13
have in Canada are people under 40
09:15
there's been a number that have actually
09:17
died as well and what's really
09:18
interesting as well is that they may be
09:21
anecdotal but there are reports of a
09:23
perfectly healthy young adults even
09:25
people are very physically fit exercise
09:27
every day and they say wow when they got
09:30
to Co fit 19 that was one of the worst
09:32
experiences in their life they could
09:34
hardly breathe for you know days and
09:36
weeks and even weeks later there was so
09:38
weak they can barely climb a set of
09:40
stairs etc so it's something I think
09:42
everyone needs to take seriously yeah
09:44
you see a lot of young people right now
09:46
caring I think less about it based on
09:49
the fact that I'm 30 to 35 I work out
09:51
every day I eat super healthy I'm 100%
09:54
immune to this and even if I get it it's
09:56
not gonna be bad I'll be able to fight
09:58
it off no problem but then you are
09:59
seeing reports like you just said of
10:01
these young people just getting full out
10:04
you may be healthy and so on but how an
10:07
individual is immune system reacts to
10:08
this virus really varies and no one as
10:11
is able to fully explain why some people
10:13
like you say perfectly healthy might
10:15
have a quite a serious sort of a result
10:18
of getting infected with this virus and
10:20
so I think it behooves everyone to take
10:22
it seriously you don't want to be that
10:24
one person in whatever uh-huh a number
10:27
of group of people that ends up by
10:28
seriously ill and needing a ventilator
10:31
and in ICU a bed so you're on the front
10:34
lines of this house Canada doing
10:35
compared to other countries right now I
10:37
think we've been somewhat fortunate in
10:39
Canada because we've been able to learn
10:41
from the experience in other countries
10:43
where the obviously the virus sort of
10:45
propagated through there the population
10:47
early based on that I think we've been
10:49
good overall I think many of the
10:51
measures we put in place in Canada in
10:53
terms of physical distancing we're done
10:55
early enough that even now we're see it
10:58
starting to see some of the benefits we
11:00
look at our so-called epidemic curve
11:02
here in Canada want to be optimistic I
11:05
would say we're sorry
11:05
to bend the curve I wouldn't say we
11:08
flatten it to where we're starting to
11:09
bend the curve even though the the data
11:12
and the taste reports are encouraging we
11:16
have to remember that what we're seeing
11:17
today in terms of the data is actually
11:19
the result of actions or activities that
11:21
we all did about two to three weeks ago
11:23
so whatever we do today
11:25
good or bad we're gonna see it in terms
11:27
of case counts etc to three weeks down
11:29
the road that's what I'm concerned
11:31
mostly about in hearing the optimistic
11:33
news and I think a lot of a lot of
11:35
people everywhere eager to get outside
11:37
eager to get back to work the second we
11:40
see a glimmer of hope I'm worried that
11:42
everyone's just gonna jump back into
11:44
things because we're just itching to my
11:47
question is like how fast could that
11:48
just be immediately reversed if no one
11:51
practices these things like right now
11:53
still even if you're feeling positive
11:55
stay inside don't know like publicly
11:59
don't non-essential businesses so is
12:01
that something that could happen quickly
12:03
and just revert back unfortunately the
12:06
answer is yes our early estimates and
12:08
also from other countries is because no
12:10
one in the population is immune so the
12:12
so-called attack rate could vary from
12:15
anywhere from 30 percent up to 70
12:17
percent of the population so if you we
12:19
actually let go and let people just sort
12:21
of go back to their normal activities it
12:23
could change very quickly up one of the
12:26
things we looked at when we were quite
12:28
worried let's say a number of weeks ago
12:30
was the so called what we call doubling
12:32
time how many days does it take to you
12:34
know double from you know 10 to 20 cases
12:36
than 40 you know from 100 cases to 200
12:38
and so on and at one point the doubling
12:41
time enough for cases in Canada was in
12:43
the order of about Oh three days or so
12:45
and that's that was that was pretty bad
12:47
now I would say the doubling time in
12:50
Canada is more in the order of greater
12:52
than 10 days so see we made quite an
12:54
improvement from you know a doubling
12:56
time of three days or so and now we're
12:58
over ten days so we want to keep that
13:00
out yeah and if this comes back again
13:02
like in the fall is this the kind of
13:04
thing that's potentially going to and if
13:06
it does is it come back with a vengeance
13:08
are we looking at this is like the
13:10
warm-up to the main event which could
13:11
happen in the fall is that something
13:13
people should be stressed about mindful
13:15
about in their actions today and moving
13:17
forward this obviously I started
13:19
in January of course this was our winter
13:21
season here in Canada but also our flu
13:23
season part of the challenge was
13:25
distinguishing between people that might
13:27
have had the seasonal flu and people had
13:29
Kovan 19 fast forward to the fall in our
13:32
winter season that really is a worry and
13:34
I would have me make an early blood now
13:36
hey everyone thanks seriously I'm
13:38
beginning a flu shot that this fall
13:41
because we don't want our hospitals to
13:43
be overloaded with patients who ill with
13:45
both Ovid 19 as well as seasonal flu
13:48
looking into like a bit of your
13:49
background and stuff knowing you've been
13:50
involved with the response to a lot of
13:52
outbreaks like SARS and h1n1 SARS being
13:56
a corona virus I'm wondering what what
13:58
have we learned from that how has that
13:59
helped us in this current situation
14:01
dealing with Kogan 19 after SARS at the
14:04
World Health Organization had it for
14:06
most as I was actually involved in that
14:08
in terms of what we call the sort of the
14:10
revision of the international health
14:11
regulations so that is sort of the only
14:14
framework that exists that still is in
14:16
play now here in Canada are certainly
14:18
out we have we had a tough time during
14:21
SARS
14:21
and a number of good things came out of
14:23
that and the agency which I work now the
14:25
public health agency of Canada was
14:27
created out of the out of the SARS
14:28
outbreak here in Canada we recognize
14:31
that we need to have sort of a maybe a
14:33
singular voice that can speak to
14:35
contains with authority and that's why
14:37
in a position of the chief public health
14:38
officer was created and dr. Tam is the
14:41
current chief public health officer and
14:42
I'm her deputies looks like a lot of
14:44
stuff came out of that that's helping us
14:45
dealing with this this is something that
14:48
I've been curious of looking up symptoms
14:50
of Cova 19 when it was kind of I want to
14:53
say first hitting the scene like a month
14:54
and a half ago for us I find that they
14:57
were there was less of them dry cough
14:59
fever stuff like that now and I look
15:02
them up I'm seeing stuff like vomiting
15:04
or diarrhea it almost seems like no
15:07
matter what you're feeling outside of
15:08
normal
15:08
it could be kovat 19 with many things
15:10
that scientific knowledge evolves over
15:13
time so you're right into beginning what
15:15
seemed to be the classic symptoms of a
15:17
respiratory infection you know the cough
15:19
the fever the shortness of breath but as
15:21
we got more and more people diagnosed
15:23
with over 19 you're right quite a number
15:25
of other symptoms came up people
15:28
complaining of headaches feeling off
15:30
even some people complained of
15:32
losing their sense of smell and taste
15:34
and also geo taste and so on any time
15:36
someone feels a bit off or not quite
15:39
right I think at this point should be a
15:42
serve considered as a possible infection
15:44
with Ovid 19 the first thing that person
15:47
should do if they do think they have it
15:48
we're what sources they go to to see
15:50
like the symptoms and then to what's
15:52
their first course of action what do
15:53
they do and where they going okay I
15:54
would say two things first of all
15:56
there's some great tell what we call
15:57
self assessment tools I would point
15:59
people to a Canada ta we've got great
16:03
tools there including a self assessment
16:04
tool as well as there's lots of great
16:06
apps on the smartphone and we've got
16:08
that the Canada coded 19 app you can
16:10
download do a self assessment if you're
16:12
feeling offer or ill and if you actually
16:15
do it the self assessment now certainly
16:18
it looks like you might have it then the
16:19
next thing I would advise is that you
16:21
need to know the number of the local
16:23
public health or local health
16:25
authorities and call them and get
16:27
direction as to what you should do where
16:29
you should go in terms of seeking a
16:30
further attention okay that's good to
16:32
know
16:32
can we look forward to any type of
16:34
vaccine timeline because obviously
16:36
that's something that's being worked on
16:37
I would have shown furiously around the
16:39
clock don't want to sound either too
16:41
optimistic or too pessimistic but
16:43
they're certainly based on what we know
16:44
and also a development of vaccines
16:46
therefore for other infectious diseases
16:49
would probably be in the ballpark of
16:50
about 12 to 18 months and that's really
16:53
- a time that you could actually what if
16:54
you say have a vaccine that's been shown
16:57
to be safe as well as effective has gone
16:59
through all of the appropriate what we
17:01
call clinical trials and ran is written
17:04
for A to B but as you say approved up by
17:06
the regulators and then obviously then
17:08
not produced on a mass scale for the
17:10
general public okay 12 to 18 months so I
17:13
guess they need they need that time to
17:15
make it work properly yeah yeah what we
17:17
have is that diminishes like a physical
17:19
distancing and so on but I would say
17:21
that now governments including ourselves
17:23
and for hopefully a bending or
17:26
flattening the curve we could maybe
17:28
start looking at and we're also going to
17:30
take the experience from other countries
17:31
are there may be certain our public
17:33
health measures we can relax but we
17:35
still need to maintain our physical
17:37
distancing but there might be certain
17:39
types of activities or businesses that
17:41
depending on the construct that might be
17:43
able to be reopened
17:45
or would permit people to hopefully get
17:48
out and do more than what did we know
17:51
just hopefully is staying at home yeah
17:53
sure get back to things and the Kia
17:55
slowly and in time in due time and that
17:58
kind of brings me to like you keep
17:59
seeing that hash tag and people talking
18:01
about the new normal when we touched on
18:02
it earlier that's kind of thinking like
18:04
what do you think that means like will
18:05
Canadians as a whole just be entering
18:07
like a new way of moving forward based
18:09
on these recent events that can we
18:10
expect protocols across all industries
18:12
to change so quite a few things you
18:14
could talk about in terms of the new
18:16
normal I would say that businesses
18:18
government included are looking at is
18:20
that what is the right balance in terms
18:22
of that what working a distance or
18:24
teleworking and so on so I think there's
18:27
always going to be a place maybe in the
18:29
future for people have to get together
18:31
physically we are social beings right
18:33
that we can't just all be working
18:34
remotely have that face time like real
18:36
face time rather than just virtually
18:38
yeah and so on depending on their
18:39
requirements for your company I
18:41
certainly tell them working I think is a
18:43
viable option I think that's going to be
18:44
a expanded or refined it in the future
18:47
so that might be part of the new normal
18:49
other things too as well in terms of how
18:52
do we get around in terms of a how
18:54
that's a public transport is designed in
18:56
a sort of a put in place that those are
18:58
other things to look at one of the other
19:01
things use of a non-medical masks you
19:04
know culturally in let's say many Asian
19:06
countries of you you're sick with a
19:08
respiratory infection it's normal
19:10
practice to wear a face mask in public
19:13
now we're just new to this but who knows
19:15
in the future there might be a legacy in
19:17
terms of a normal practice for everyone
19:19
to go in public with let's say a
19:21
non-medical face mask if you have a cold
19:24
and then I think a final part of the new
19:25
normal is I think people are starting to
19:28
appreciate the importance to the extent
19:30
that it's it's feasible and people are
19:32
willing to let's say I do a ro pea maybe
19:35
a bitter extra for being self-sufficient
19:37
for example with the mad rush globally
19:40
not to get personal protective equipment
19:42
all those famous and 95 masks that are
19:45
made in other parts of the world we're
19:47
also looking at domestic capacity to
19:49
make sure that we have that type of
19:50
essential medical equipment being made
19:53
here in Canada so we could always quote
19:55
have that stability of supply but then
19:57
if you look at our being a
19:58
self-sufficient
19:59
to what extent in terms of our people
20:01
ready to maybe a pay bit more whatever
20:04
but support the local economies but also
20:06
it's easier in terms of getting food
20:09
there rather than worrying about where
20:10
it's shipped from from around the world
20:12
so those are kind of some of the things
20:14
I'm thinking about that might be part of
20:16
quote a new normal moving forward do you
20:19
think they'll have a that this will have
20:20
an impact on just the mental health of a
20:23
lot of young people and just people in
20:24
general while we've been in lockdown
20:26
like you think it'll impact you but is
20:28
there things we can do to you know
20:30
mitigate that certainly self isolation
20:32
and so on it's putting us a lot of
20:34
stress on people so I think that in the
20:36
short term I think there's lots of
20:38
things people can do in terms of their
20:39
mental health there are various numbers
20:42
or resources online phone lines chat
20:46
lines that people can avail themselves
20:47
off in terms of having someone to speak
20:49
to certainly I think in terms of long
20:51
term in terms of a mental health
20:53
services supports those are things that
20:54
we need to also think about but I think
20:57
overall especially for young people I
20:59
think young people are pretty resilient
21:01
- my kids tell me you know in a certain
21:03
kind of tone you say it is what it is so
21:06
yeah it's going to deal with it that's
21:08
one of the things I think young people
21:10
are good at you know you deal with the
21:11
situation and you move on one of the
21:13
things I will mention though I think
21:15
it's something maybe not so much for
21:16
young people but all of us are
21:17
eventually gonna get old so I think
21:19
there's going to be I think a big
21:21
national conversation at some point in
21:23
terms of how do we deal with our older
21:26
generations in terms of you know nursing
21:28
homes that how do we make sure that you
21:30
have the right supports and even the the
21:32
healthcare work is they taking care of
21:34
them some of the issues obviously coming
21:35
up right now we recognize we need to
21:37
think about those types of settings as
21:40
well as our other vulnerable populations
21:43
for example the homeless and and so on
21:45
so those are things I think the young
21:46
people of today I think hopefully in a
21:49
good way
21:50
Sita I see these challenges and
21:52
hopefully maybe take them on as their
21:53
own and being the people to solve and
21:55
deal with them in the future that's
21:57
